# Find segments (lines) of a face.

Find segments (lines) of a face.

## Usage

``` r
hullSegment(
  vertices,
  hull = geometry::convhulln(vertices),
  tol = mean(mean(abs(vertices))) * sqrt(.Machine$double.eps)
)
```

## Arguments

- vertices:

  A `m x p` array of vertices of the convex hull, as used by
  [`geometry::convhulln()`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/geometry/man/convhulln.html).

- hull:

  Tessellation (or triangulation) generated by
  [`geometry::convhulln()`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/geometry/man/convhulln.html)
  If hull is left empty or not supplied, then it will be generated.

- tol:

  Tolerance on the tests for inclusion in the convex hull. You can think
  of `tol` as the distance a point may possibly lie outside the hull,
  and still be perceived as on the surface of the hull. Because of
  numerical slop nothing can ever be done exactly here. I might guess a
  semi-intelligent value of `tol` to be

  `tol = 1.e-13*mean(abs(vertices(:)))`

  In higher dimensions, the numerical issues of floating point
  arithmetic will probably suggest a larger value of `tol`.

## Value

A matrix with segments.
