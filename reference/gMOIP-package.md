# gMOIP: Tools for 2D and 3D Plots of Single and Multi-Objective Linear/Integer Programming Models

Make 2D and 3D plots of linear programming (LP), integer linear
programming (ILP), or mixed integer linear programming (MILP) models
with up to three objectives. Plots of both the solution and criterion
space are possible. For instance the non-dominated (Pareto) set for
bi-objective LP/ILP/MILP programming models (see vignettes for an
overview). The package also contains an function for checking if a point
is inside the convex hull.
